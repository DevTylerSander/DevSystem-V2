# Persistent Data

All persistent data for DevSystem-V2 is stored in the `data/` directory as JSON files.

- **tags.json**: Stores all quick message tags.
- **developers.json**: Stores all registered developers and their info. Only users listed here can use certain commands (like PayPal).
- **paypal.json**: Stores each developer's PayPal.me link by user ID.
- Other files store customer, commission, and task data.

You can edit these files manually if needed, but it is recommended to use the bot's commands to manage data.
